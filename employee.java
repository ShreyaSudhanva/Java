/*12. Given that an EMPLOYEE class contains the following members:
Members: Employee ID, Employee Name, Department name &amp; Basic Pay
Methods: To read each employee details, to calculate Gross Pay and to print the employee details.
Develop an application to read data of N employees and compute the Gross Pay and Net Pay of each
employee.
Gross Pay = Basic Pay + DA + HRA (DA = 58% of Basic Pay, HRA = 16% of Basic Pay)
Net Pay = Gross â€“ Income Tax
Income Tax calculated as follows:
Gross Pay - Up to 2 lakhs - Nil
Above 2 and up to 3 lakhs - 10% of the Gross Pay
Above 3 and up to 5 lakhs - 15% of the Gross Pay and
Above 5 lakhs 30 % of the Gross Pay, an additional charge of 2% of the tax will be added to total
tax*/
